# JARVIS Next-Gen AI Personal Assistant

## Vision
A next-generation AI personal assistant inspired by JARVIS, capable of autonomous research, self-improvement, secure operation, and extensibility, with a focus on privacy and user control.

## Architecture Overview
- **User Interaction Layer**: Text (CLI/Web), voice (future), customizable personality
- **Conversational Context Engine**: Short/long-term memory, anticipation, personalization
- **Core AI Reasoning**: NLP, planning, research, self-improvement
- **Research & Web Search**: Real-time, sourceful, synthesis
- **Code Modification/Self-Diagnosis**: Sandboxed, auditable, rollback
- **Integration Layer**: Plugins, smart home, cloud
- **Data Storage & Privacy**: Encrypted, user-controlled

## Phase 1: Foundation
1. System architecture & core interfaces
2. Basic conversational UI (text-based)
3. Context engine (short-term memory)
4. Real-time web search with source attribution
5. Secure, auditable code modification sandbox
6. Encrypted local data storage
7. Initial testing & documentation

## Security & Privacy
- All user data is encrypted at rest
- Code modifications are sandboxed and logged
- User controls for data export and deletion
